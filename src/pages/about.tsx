            Our Story
          </h1>

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
         CarVerse was founded with a simple belief: buying a used car
            shouldn't be stressful. We saw how the traditional used car market
            was plagued with trust issues, hidden defects, and murky pricing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Starting from a small garage in Mumbai, we've grown to become one
            of India's most trusted platforms for certified pre-owned vehicles.
            Every car on our platform goes through a comprehensive 200-point
            inspection.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Today, we've helped over 10,000 happy customers find their perfect
            ride, and we're just getting started.
